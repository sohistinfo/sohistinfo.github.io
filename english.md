# 🖳 About

The **Socio-History of Informatics Seminar** is a research seminar organized by the [HT2S research center](https://technique-societe.cnam.fr/histoire-des-technosciences-en-societe-ht2s--913760.kjsp) of the National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts. Every two months, we invite a researcher in the history and/or anthropology and sociology (with a historical or diachronic approach) of computing and informatics to present their work. The seminar aims to explore new narratives in the history of computing and informatics over time, with an emphasis on they intertwine with social, economic, political and cultural issues.

Below is a more detailed view of our approach.


# 📅 Program

#### December 16, 2024, from 3 PM to 5 PM 
_The present is boring, but the future is bright?! A transnational history of the introduction of computers in education since the 1960s_
- [Barbara Hof](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Barbara-Hof) - University of Lausanne (Switzerland)
- Discussant: [Ronan Le Roux](https://lis.u-pec.fr/membres/membres-titulaires/le-roux-ronan) - Université Paris-Est Créteil, INSPE (France)

> The arrival of new technologies in education has always been shaped by contradictory visions. On the one hand, technologies stoked fears of a loss of competence and the restriction of learners through behaviorist teaching systems; on the other hand, technologies were praised as a means of acquiring skills more quickly through greater individuality. The turbulent history of the slow introduction of computers in schools since the 1960s clearly demonstrates this.
As a contribution to the research seminar, this talk will address how the use of computers in education has been repeatedly touted as a breakthrough and reformer of education systems in many countries, while there has always been a mismatch between imaginaries and reality. Of particular interest are the economic and political conditions surrounding this development, as well as some of the key transnational and local actors, and the intermediaries connecting them.
Examining expectations of educational technologies helps to uncover some of the underlying assumptions that drive innovation. The talk is based on the author’s contribution to a forthcoming book chapter that will add a historical perspective to the growing critical literature questioning the futurism inherent in digital educational media.

_A "Sovereign Intelligence"? Infrastructures, Representations, and Geopolitics of Russian AI: A Comparative Approach_
- [Ksenia Ermoshina](https://cis.cnrs.fr/en/ksenia_ermoshina/) and [Boris Melnichenko](https://cis.cnrs.fr/en/boris_melnichenko/) - CNRS, Centre Internet et Société (France)
- Discussant: [Benjamin Bürbaumer](https://www.centreemiledurkheim.fr/notre-equipe/benjamin-burbaumer/) - Sciences Po Bordeaux (France)

> As part of the ANR CulturIA project, this investigation focuses on the contemporary history of artificial intelligence and its socio-cultural aspects, particularly within the Russian-speaking world and its international relations. Marked by the war against Ukraine and economic sanctions, the field has undergone a restructuring both in terms of infrastructure and in terms of discourse and representations. The collective research, conducted in collaboration with Boris Melnichenko, follows Russians who create or use AI in exile as well as engineers working for large companies in Russia. In line with the spirit of Science and Technology Studies (STS), it remains attentive to code and infrastructure and describes the significant restructurings of technological projects in the context of a major geopolitical crisis. By comparing Russian machine learning and AI projects with similar initiatives from the United States and China, this research asks: can we speak of a "Russian AI"? Are there distinctive characteristics that define the ways of developing and discussing AI specific to Russia, despite the inevitable borrowing, influences, and transnational exchanges that shape this field?

# 💭 Our approach

Informatique, Informatiks, Informatics… The term, largely internationalized, is subject to semantic variations which reflect the different contexts of use of a very unstable field, having as a common denominator the transformation of information in systems. Whether they are logical and mechanical, industrial or artisanal, or even formal or social systems, this lability interests us. After all, don’t the “human calculators” who populated the banks and accounting offices of the 19th century participate with full rights in the history of computers? And if, to use a canon of Computing history, the computer has become "universal", are not computers and their process marked by local and specific dynamics, certainly relative but also questioning this universality?

This research seminar will look at the history of informatics not for itself and within the circumscribed and well-identified framework of the omnipotent computer and its pervasive environments, but through the study of situations where computing and informatics plays a pivotal role in articulating science-technology-society relationships. In this way, this seminar aims to shed light on a socio-history of informatics over the long term and in wider spaces on geographical, social, cultural, political and economic levels.

The historical view of computing has already been able, among other things, to benefit from studies on the profession and the social position of programmers in a society of expertise or from processes of social distinctions which sideline certain groups in the field (deskilling of women coders, exploitation of click workers or metal miners for electronics, loss of expertise and know-how to the test of automation or artificial intelligence, etc.). It also questioned the meeting of work and leisure, in places of practices and knowledge which deploy socio-economic aspects, from community recruitment to the logic of industrial recovery. Finally, it has largely focused on scientific or industrial developments in national frameworks, but also in inter- or trans-national relations which govern (or are subjected to) the circulation of computers, software, digital texts and associated practices. Increasingly, they are re-examining identities – gender, race, class – through the prism of computer practices. We are part of this continuity.

Two general orientations will guide our invitations and discussions:
- Attention to local conditions of design, production and practice of IT, at different scales (regional, national, transnational and global).
- Attention to the materiality of information which is incorporated into and takes the form of machines, gestures and tools, professions and other social and cultural positions, therefore socio-technical environments – including conceptual and logical aspects, as well as the way in which (infra)structures are categorized through the way in which we look at and practice computer science objects.

With regard to these orientations, this seminar wishes to depart from the standard and canonical narratives which nourish the history of computing: through geographical decentering, by identifying spaces of otherness in relation to the “great” modern technoscientific development; and by the shift in points of view, by calling into question the usual categories of analysis of the computer phenomenon. Indeed, the history of informatics is still often an eminently modern story – even a myth – of a conquest of man over the mechanized, then automated, processing of thought and matter. In this, it is part of a double long-term genealogy: that of mathematics and formal sciences more generally, and that of engineering and its relationship to the industrialization of processes.

This “computer culture” (often equivalent to so-called “digital culture”), a culturalized approach to computing, that is to say acculturated in the techno-scientific myths of a society, must be understood in its mechanisms of selection, distinction, construction. This particularly marks the stories about national IT, from its equipment to its industries, from its research to its development – ​​and therefore the creation of IT heritage. To take just one example, this was the case for the early opening of the Bletchley Park archives in the United Kingdom in the 1970s, suddenly shedding light on the role of Alan Turing and the Enigma machine, in order to claim a key role in the history of computing as the commercialization of computers accelerates.

We can also question the default positivity of the grand narrative of IT, by studying the inclusion of IT production and practice in issues that go beyond it: the environmental cost of so-called intangible technologies (pollution from industrial production to electronic waste and the general disruption of ecosystems); the confrontation of the circulation of IT goods with the logic of international relations beyond scientific and industrial exchanges; or the imposition of digital development policies on populations that are not concerned, or who suffer from them; or finally, putting it into perspective with the absences, refusals, resistance, inertia and non-use of certain territories and their actors.

Finally, this seminar will take care to promote an interdisciplinary opening towards other social sciences, in particular philosophy, sociology, anthropology, making it possible to renew concepts and question the usual categories of analysis of the computer phenomenon.
