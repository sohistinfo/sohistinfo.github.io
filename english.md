# üñ≥ About

The **Computing Socio-History Seminar** is a research seminar organized by the [HT2S research center](https://technique-societe.cnam.fr/histoire-des-technosciences-en-societe-ht2s--913760.kjsp) of the Conservatoire National des Arts et M√©tiers. Every two months, we invite a researcher in the history and/or anthropology and sociology (with a historical or diachronic approach) of computing and informatics to present their work. Below, you will find a more detailed view of our approach.

# üìÖ Next dates

The seminar will start at the beginning of the 2024 academic year and the speakers will be announced shortly.
The proposed dates are:

- October 14, 2024, from 3 PM to 5 PM
- December 16, 2024, from 3 PM to 5 PM
- February 10, 2025, from 3 PM to 5 PM
- April 14, 2025, from 3 PM to 5 PM
- June 16, 2025, from 3 PM to 5 PM

# üìç Location 

The seminar is hybrid and will be held at the Conservatoire National des Arts et M√©tiers, located at **2 rue Cont√©, 75003 Paris**. The connection link and exact location will be communicated on this page before the event.


# üí≠ Our approach

_Informatique, Informatiks, Informatics.._. The term, widely internationalized, is subject to semantic variations reflecting the different contexts of use of a very fluid field, with the common denominator of transforming information within systems. Whether these are logical and mechanical systems, industrial or artisanal, or even formal or social, this fluidity interests us. After all, don't the "human computers" that populated banks and accounting offices in the 19th century fully participate in the history of computers? And if, to borrow a canon of Computing history, the computer has become "universal," isn't computing (or "computings") marked by local and specific dynamics, which are relative but also challenge this universality?

This research seminar will focus on the history of computing not for its own sake and within the well-defined and circumscribed framework of the omnipotent computer and its pervasive environments, but by studying situations where computing plays a pivotal role in articulating the relationships between science, technology, and society. In this, the seminar aims to shed light on a socio-history of computing over the long term and across expanded spaces, both geographically and socially, culturally, politically, and economically.

The historical perspective on computing has already benefited, among other things, from studies on the profession and social position of programmers in an expert society, or from processes of social distinctions that marginalize certain groups in the field (deskilling of women coders, exploitation of click workers or metal miners for electronics, loss of expertise and know-how in the face of automation or artificial intelligence‚Ä¶). It has also explored the intersection of work and leisure in places of practice and knowledge that deploy socio-economic aspects, from community engagements to industrial recuperation logics. Furthermore, it has extensively examined scientific or industrial developments within national frameworks, as well as the inter- or trans-national relations that govern (or are subject to) the circulation of computers, software, and associated texts and practices. Increasingly, it reexamines identities ‚Äì of gender, race, and class ‚Äì through the lens of computing practices. We situate ourselves within this continuity.

Two general orientations will guide our invitations and discussions:

- Attention to the local conditions of design, production, and practice of computing at different scales (regional, national, transnational, and global).
- Attention to the materiality of information as it is embodied in and takes the form of machines, gestures and tools, professions, and other social and cultural positions, thus shaping socio-technical environments. This includes conceptual and logical aspects, as well as how (infra)structures are categorized through the way we view and engage with computing objects.

In light of these orientations, this seminar aims to move away from the standard and canonical narratives that typically inform the history of computing. This will be achieved through geographical decentering, by identifying spaces of alterity relative to the "great" modern technoscientific development; and by shifting perspectives, questioning the usual categories of analysis of the computing phenomenon. Indeed, the history of computing often still falls under the eminently modern narrative ‚Äì or even myth ‚Äì of human conquest over the mechanized, and then automated, processing of thought and matter. In this way, it fits into a dual, long-term genealogy: that of mathematics and formal sciences more generally, and that of engineering and its relationship to the industrialization of processes.

This "culture of computing" (or "digital culture"), a culturalized approach to computing ‚Äì that is, acculturated within the techno-scientific myths of a society ‚Äì must be understood in its mechanisms of selection, distinction, and construction. This particularly marks the narratives about national computing, from its equipment to its industries, from its research to its development ‚Äì and thus the constitution of computing heritage. To take just one example, this was the case with the early opening of the Bletchley Park archives in the United Kingdom in the 1970s, which suddenly highlighted the role of Alan Turing and the Enigma machine to claim a key role in the history of computing as computer commercialization was accelerating.

We can also question the inherent positivity of the grand narrative of computing by examining the integration of computing production and practice into broader issues. These include the environmental cost of so-called immaterial technologies (from industrial production pollution to electronic waste and the overall disruption of ecosystems); the confrontation of the circulation of computing goods with the logic of international relations beyond scientific and industrial exchanges; the imposition of digital development policies on non-concerned or negatively affected populations; and, finally, the perspective of absences, refusals, resistances, inertias, and non-usage in certain territories and by certain actors.

To conclude, this seminar will strive to foster an interdisciplinary openness towards other social sciences, particularly philosophy, sociology, and anthropology, enabling the renewal of concepts and questioning the usual categories of analysis of the computing phenomenon.
